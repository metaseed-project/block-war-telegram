# block-war-telegram

Helps to block Russian telegram channels.


### You could use this code to block Russian telegram channels automatically

The instruction will be added soon

For now, just

`npm install`
`cd src`
`node index.js`

I will add image recognition and API for updating channel link automatically soon.

And yes, I know about telegram [API for blocking accounts](https://core.telegram.org/method/account.reportPeer), but I will leave it to you guys to work on)
